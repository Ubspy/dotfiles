# Post Install Guide (this part is more for me specifically, but if you wanna read it go ahead)
- Add new user using `useradd -m -G [group] -s [shell for user] [username]`
- Install `xorg xorg-xinit` to have a display server and also start the display server using `startx`
- Go to the [Arch Mirror List Generator](https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/) to get a mirror list that doesn't download at 4 bits a second
- If you wanna be extra epic, you can [sort the mirrors by speed](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors#List_by_speed)
